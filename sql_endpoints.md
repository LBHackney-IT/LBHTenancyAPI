  frequency_lookup.lu_desc as frequency_display_name,
  aragdet.aragdet_amount as amount,
  arag.arag_breached as has_been_breached,
  arag.arag_comment as comment
FROM [dbo].[arag] arag
INNER JOIN [dbo].[aragdet] aragdet
ON arag.arag_sid = aragdet.arag_sid
LEFT JOIN [dbo].[lookup] frequency_lookup
ON aragdet.aragdet_frequency = frequency_lookup.lu_ref
LEFT JOIN [dbo].[lookup] status_lookup
ON arag.arag_status = status_lookup.lu_ref
WHERE arag.tag_ref = '000075/01'
AND frequency_lookup.lu_type = 'ZPS'

LEFT JOIN [dbo].[debtype] debtype
ON rtrans.trans_type = debtype.deb_code
WHERE tag_ref = '000015/01';
```

### Get counts

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [dbo].[rtrans] WHERE tag_ref = '000075/01') as transactions_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [dbo].[araction] WHERE tag_ref = '000075/01') as arrears_action_events_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [dbo].[arag] WHERE tag_ref = '000075/01') as arrears_agreements_count
```
